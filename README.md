# Employee and Manager Salary Management

This is Anjali Krishna, a sophomore enrolled in the ISM 3232 class. My U-Number is U35346496. This coding challenge is a simple JavaScript program to manage employee salaries and extend its functionality to handle specialized salary calculations for managers, including bonuses.

## Classes Implemented

- **Employee:** A class with properties for name and salary, and a method to calculate and return the annual salary.
- **Manager:** A subclass of Employee that includes a department property and overrides the annual salary calculation method to include a 15% bonus.
